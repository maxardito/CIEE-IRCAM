## Individual Classes

1. Course Intro: Basics of working with Max. Fundamentals of algorithmic composition. Fundamentals of electronic music performance.

2. Modular Synthesis: FM/AM/PM/RM, additive synthesis, tuning methods, sum & difference tones

3. Sound Objects: envelopes, sequencers, euclydian rhythms, poly~, MIDI mapping (matrix, matrixctl, adsr, function, gate, ggate)

4. Buffers: granular synthesis, sampling, wavetable synthesis, MC 

5. Filters: highpass, lowpass, bandpass, formant filters. Delays: tapin tapout, comb~, teeth~

6. Spatialization: mixing, panning, vector synthesis, 3D Audio. Organizing and refactoring your patches. (bpatcher, qlist, ";" messages, preset, pattr, autopattr, global transport, clocks, outputting info to Ableton & other DAWs, MIDI mapping)

7. Assignment 1: Musique Concrète, compose musique concrète piece in Max or within DAW (Given after first weekend)

9. Intro to realtime DSP: reverb, compression, transient detection, envelope following, real-time sampling, and other studio techniques (+ review of realtime effects such as using input amplitude to control synths, edge detection. Show vids of boulez antheme 2, repons, saariaho, live processing pieces, etc.)
